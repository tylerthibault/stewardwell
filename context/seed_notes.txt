Important Notes:
- Always maintain all three demo families in the seed file:
  1. Tyler's Family (TYLER1)
  2. Joe's Family (JOEJR1)
  3. Curtis's Family (CURT1S)
- These families are used for testing and demonstration purposes
- Each family should have a parent and two children
- Each family should have their own set of chores, categories, and goals
- Maintain consistent family codes: TYLER1, JOEJR1, CURT1S
